        <p class="body">Hey, there! My name is Eashan, and I'm in 7th grade. Online(except here), I go by the pseudonym Halamcage. I code Java, and I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also slowly learning Blender to fulfill my passion of 3D Art. I hope to become a cardiac surgeon one day. It's very interesting.</p>
        <p class="body">I read a <span class="italics">lot</span> of books. My favorite book of all time would be the <span class="italics">Mortal Engines</span> Quartet by Philip Reeve. I also enjoyed <span class="italics">The Selfish Gene</span> by Richard Dawkins, and I hope to read his other works. I am currently reading the <span class="italics">Dune</span> series by Frank Herbert and the <span class="italics">Divergent</span> trilogy by Veronica Roth.</p>
        <p class="body">I also write. I have been writing short stories since 5th grade, and I am currently working on a novel with my friend, Ray. It is an action-packed sci-fi spy novel that I plan to border on fantasy.</p>
        <p class="body">Filmmaking and photography also capture my interest.</p>
